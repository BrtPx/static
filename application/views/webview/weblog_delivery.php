            <ul>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i>All products are inspected for factory flaws before being added to our inventory.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i>After purchase, the bought goods are inspected once again, with all accompanying accessories verified. </li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i>Warranties and/or authenticity certificates are issued as dictated by the manufacturer. It is important to note different products have different warranty periods. Be sure to make note of it.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i>The bought products are then securely packaged and signed out to our couriers for delivery.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i>Patazon ships out products everyday in the evening, to be received latest by noon of the next day.</li>
