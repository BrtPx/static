        Food is fundamentally important to not only stave off hunger, but to encourage growth and development, and build stronger immunity in both adults and children. Keeping food safe and fresh is in the best interest of every household.

        <h3>Size?</h3>
        <p class="longcopy">
            It is best to get a fridge that can comfortably fit in your kitchen. A standard refrigerator is usually 1 meter wide, 1-2 meter high and 1 meter deep.
        </p>
        <h3>Refrigerator vs Freezer</h3>
        <p class="longcopy">
            A refrigerator maintains an internal temperature of 1&#8451; - 4&#8451; while a freezer is set at -18&#8451;.
            <br>
            Today's household fridges have a combination of both refrigeration section and freezer section. Freezers are fridges with just a freezer section.
        </p>
        <h3>Type?</h3>
        <p class="longcopy">
            French door fridges have two top doors to open the refrigeration section and bottom door for the freezer section.
            <br>
            Side-by-Side fridges have two doors that open from the center.
            <br>
            Top-mount fridges places the freezer section above the refrigeration section, each with its own door.
            <br>
            Bottom-mount fridges places the freezer section below the refrigeration section, each with its own door.
            <br>
            Display fridges have a commercial glass door.
            <br>
            Freezers are either upright freezers suitable for short term storage or chest freezers suitable for long term storage.
        </p>
        <h3>Fresh Foods or Frozen Foods?</h3>
        <p class="longcopy">
            Fresh foods are stored in the refrigeration section while frozen foods are better off stored in the freezer section.
            <br>
            A top-mount fridge is better for those who consume more frozen foods than fresh foods because it typically has a larger freezer section than the bottom-mount fridge, alternatively a freezer is a also a cool choice.
            <br>
            A side-by-side fridge is evenly split between the refrigeration section and freezer section.
