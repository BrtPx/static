        <h3>Energy Efficiency?</h3>
        <p class="longcopy">
            Different heaters and coolers have different energy ratings normally expressed using an 'energy star rating' illustrated on the packaging. Some products come with energy saving modes, automatic sensors that adjust heating and cooling levels depending on how cool or warm the room is and timers to control when to power them on or shut them off.

        <h3>Portability and Space?</h3>
        <p class="longcopy">
            These devices only require an electrical outlet and are good to go. For specialized needs (such as the space of your rooms or desired range of heat or cold dispersion), they can be mounted onto walls while some are stand-alone devices that can be moved from room to room.

        <h3>Sound Levels?</h3>
        <p class="longcopy">
            Because of the use of motors and fans to generate or lower heat. Some noise is to be expected.
