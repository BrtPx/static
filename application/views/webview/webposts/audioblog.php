        <p class="longcopy">
            Power is an important consideration because the speaker driver has to work hard to produce sounds waves audible to the human ear.

        <h3>Size?</h3>
        <p class="longcopy">
            It is recommended to have a large subwoofer with a lot of power. The audio quality from a large subwoofer at a volume level of 4 is much better than from a small subwoofer at a volume level of 12.
